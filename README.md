## Introduction

Clean code is a reader-focused development style that produces software that's easy to write, read, and maintain. This repository contains a few examples of bad code that demonstrate common pitfalls and practices we should avoid.

The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on experience in transforming "bad code" into clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you'd like to get involved, here's how you can help:

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. Find an example that interests you and **refactor the code** following clean code principles.
4. **Add comments** to explain your changes and why they improve the code.
5. **Commit your changes** and push them to your forked repository.
6. Submit a **pull request** to this repository with a clear description of what you have improved.

## Clean Code Principles

Some key principles to keep in mind while refactoring:

- **Meaningful Names:** Variables, functions, classes, and other entities should have meaningful names that describe their purpose.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function or class should have one responsibility or reason to change.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code by abstracting common functionality.
- **Readability:** Write code that is easy to read and understand, even for someone who did not write it.
- **Comment Judiciously:** Use comments to explain "why" rather than "what". The code itself should reveal the "what".

For more principles, you can refer to Robert C. Martin's book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship".
